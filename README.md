As part of regular health checkup, people undergo blood tests at their healthcare provider. This is aimed at the NHS system in the UK, but can be adapted to other ecosystems as well.
Usually, the lab test results are presented in multiple messages with a lot of numbers about concentration of various elements in the blood. Also included are the "normal" ranges. What the numbers mean is not included. To help the patient, many hyper links to external sources are provided.
Many a times, if the results of certain tests are not in the expected range, the summary result is shown as "Abnormal, contact a doctor". This causes a lot of panic in most patients, who do not know if the severity of the issue warrants urgent attention - and getting doctor appointments in the UK is difficult - few slots and sometimes waiting time of months.
This causes distress to the person who has received the test results.

Why are agents the right solution to this problem
The problem can be best solved by agents as there are multiple, clearly separate tasks to be performed. Agents can corelate information across different data sources and help identify inputs for relevant messages. Articulation of summary in plain english is possible with the latest in generative technology, with links to specific sources of reference information. Such agents can easily help advise next steps and prioritise actions.
Also the summarisation of findings and presenting in easily understandable language is task for the generative AI agents!
What's the overall architecture? 
I tried multiple solutions - one with specific agents, another with all code inline (sequiential) in one file. The agents are driven by targeted prompts and use search on specific knowledge sources for information.
